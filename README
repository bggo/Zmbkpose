############################# Zmbkpose ################################

The zmbkpose tool is a shell script that does hot backup and hot restore of ZCS
Opensource accounts, GPL(OPENSOURCE). It can run from any host in the net, 
which means that it can be set on a backup server already existent.

It was concepted after Zimbra released ZCS 5.0.12, where a new import/export 
feature was exposed to user can be able to do his archiving. From that point 
it was clear for me that I just need to write a code to automatically get all
user data from server, remotely via HTTP SOAP. Plus LDAP data. So, it is 
possible to run full backups and restore even deleted accounts.

Till now, zmbkpose provides

    Full backup of all accounts;
    Full backup of any account;
    Incremental backup of all accounts;
    Incremental backup of any account;
    Lists all backup sessions done;
    Restore all contents (mail, contacts, appointments...) to any account;
    Restore deleted accounts back to directory and all of its contents;
    Restore only account attributes, like password, class of service;
    Configurable full simultaneously backup; 

This tool DOES NOT DO disaster recovery.
